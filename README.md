# MyReads Project

This is was made as a required project for udacity react nanodegree. I started it forking from the template
project available at [MyReads at udacity github repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git)

## TL;DR

To put it to work right away:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

Hope you enjoy it<a><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/IgorCRD/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/18318ca9/src/icons/smile.svg"/></a>
