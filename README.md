# MyReads Project

This project is a required component for udacity react nanodegree.

I started it forking from the template project available at [MyReads at udacity github repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git)

## TL;DR

To put it to work right away:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Extra features
### Toaster alerts (visible in gifs below)
Toaster alerts are shown everytime a book moves between shelves or is removed from a shelf. The toaster indicates the update status of the book being moved.

### Drag and drop books with autoscroll while dragging
Books can be dragged from its original shelf and dropped to a new shelf.

### Search input with debounce and loader
Search input has a debounce delay of 300ms before the search event is fired. After the event is fired the screen will show a loader while the results are being retrieved from server.
